## [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) (June 2018 version)

#### Good Design Principles
- Stop guessing your capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days

### The Five Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework

#### Operational Excellence

##### Design Principles for Operational Excellence
-Perform operations as code - limit human error and enable consistent responses to events
-Annotate documentation
-Make frequent, small, reversible changes
-Refine operations procedures frequently
-Anticipate failure
-Learn from all operational failures

##### Best Practices - Prepare, Operate, Evolve
- OPS 1: What factors drive your operational priorities?
  - Evaluate Business neets
  - Evaluate compliance requirements
  - Evaluate risk
- OPS 2: How do you design your workload to enable operability?
  - Share design standards
  - Design for cloud operations
  - Provide insights into workload behavior
  - Provide insights into customer behavior
  - Implement practices that reduce defects, ease remediation and improve flow
  - Mitigate deployment risks

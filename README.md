## [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) (June 2018 version)

#### Good Design Principles
- Stop guessing your capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days

### The Five Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework

#### Operational Excellence

##### Design Principles for Operational Excellence
- Perform operations as code - limit human error and enable consistent responses to events
- Annotate documentation
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

##### Best Practices - Prepare, Operate, Evolve
- OPS 1: What factors drive your operational priorities?
  - Evaluate Business neets
  - Evaluate compliance requirements
  - Evaluate risk
- OPS 2: How do you design your workload to enable operability?
  - Share design standards
  - Design for cloud operations
  - Provide insights into workload behavior
  - Provide insights into customer behavior
  - Implement practices that reduce defects, ease remediation and improve flow
  - Mitigate deployment risks
- OPS 3: How do you know that you are ready to support a workload?
  - Continuous improvement culture
  - Share understanding of the value to the business
  - Ensure personnel capability
  - Documented accessible governance and guidance
  - Use checklists
  - Use playbooks
  - Practice recovery
- OPS 4: What factors drive your understanding of operational health?
  - Define expected business and customer outcomes
  - Identify success metrics
  - Identify workload metrics
  - Identify ops metrics
  - Established baselines
  - Collect and analyze metrics
  - Validate indights
  - Business-level view of ops
- OPS 5: How do you manage operational events?
  - Determine priority of operational events based on business impact
  - Processes for event, incident, and problem management
  - Process per alert
  - ID decision makers
  - Define escalation paths
  - Push notifications
  - Communicate status through dashboards
  - Process for root cause analysis
- OPS 6: How do you evolve operations?
  - frequent small improvements; providing safe environments and time to experiment, develop, and test improvements; and environments in which learning from failures is encouraged
  - Process for Continuous Improvement
  - Define drivers for improvement
  - Implement feedback loops
  - Document and share lessons learned
  - Perform ops metrics reviews
###### Key AWS Services
- AWS CloudFormation = essential to Ops Excellence
